            <p class="bio">Hello! I'm Adam Openbrier and I am currently studying at The Coding Bootcamp at University of California Irvine. The course focuses on MERN stack web development. I hope to use my new skills to continue learning in the development world.</p>
            <p class="bio">New languages have always interested and excited me. I have spent time individually learning a few human languages as well. With my basic Spanish knowledge I can translate a brochure or take the mic at karaoke. I can also be found practicing simple Vietnamese in restaurants or cafes. My first experiences with programming date back more than a decade ago with C++ and Visual Basic. More recently a trial with Ruby kept my attention.</p>
            <p class="bio">Working on applications isn't only knowing the language but requires a bit of creativity. My hobbies reflect the ability and ambition to take on new challenges. Designing and producing clothing and costumes has been both fun and complex. After developing an idea, progress is met with obstacles. I've learned to problem-solve and find inspiration to reach my visions. That's the art in coding and the reward that drives me to continue.</p>
